# 🧠 BLOCKCHAIN_AI
### AI + Blockchain Prototype for Secure Document Verification  
*Developed by Karthik Naik K*

---

## 📄 Overview
**BLOCKCHAIN_AI** is a conceptual project that demonstrates how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Blockchain** can be combined to securely verify and store digital documents.  
It was developed using **WideCanvas.ai**, a no-code AI project builder, as part of an academic project during the final semester of engineering.

The system simulates an **AI model** that validates uploaded documents and then records their details on a **mock blockchain ledger** to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Platform:** [WideCanvas.ai](https://widecanvas.ai) (No-code / Low-code builder)  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Design:** Tailwind CSS  
- **AI Simulation:** Mock AI logic  
- **Blockchain:** Simulated blockchain ledger  
- **Storage:** Local or browser-based (no backend database)

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ Upload documents for verification  
✅ Mock AI validation (checks document authenticity)  
✅ Simulated blockchain entry for secure storage  
✅ Document verification using unique ID  
✅ Simple, user-friendly web interface

## 🧩 Project Workflow
1. **Admin Uploads Document:**  
   The admin uploads a scanned certificate or document through the interface.

2. **AI Validation (Mock):**  
   A simulated AI process analyzes the file and determines if it’s authentic.

3. **Blockchain Entry:**  
   The system stores the document details (like hash, ID, and metadata) into a mock blockchain ledger for integrity.

4. **Verification:**  
   Users can verify any document by entering its unique ID and checking its blockchain record.

## 🧠 What Does “Mock” Mean Here?
- **Mock AI:** No real machine learning model is trained. Instead, it simulates the behavior of an AI that would normally verify documents.  
- **Mock Blockchain:** No live blockchain (like Ethereum or Hyperledger) is used. The code mimics blockchain operations like hashing and linking blocks.  

This allows the system to **demonstrate real-world logic** without requiring complex back-end deployment.

---

## 🔧 Limitations
- No real blockchain or AI backend.  
- No database or API integration.  
- Limited to local or static testing.  

---

## 🌱 Future Enhancements
- Integrate **Flask or FastAPI backend** for dynamic verification.  
- Add a **trained ML model** for genuine AI-based validation.  
- Connect to **Ethereum Testnet** or **Hyperledger Fabric** for real blockchain functionality.  
- Add user authentication and dashboard for multiple roles (Admin / Verifier).
